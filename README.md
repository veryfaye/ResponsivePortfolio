## Description

As a student of the UCSD Coding Bootcamp this is my portfolio site to display my work, and provide a contact page. I created this site using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Using Bootstraps grid system, I designed this page mobil first.

There are three pages of this site:
 * The Home page is an about me page, with a short description of myself.
 * The Portfolio page has a collection of the assignments I am most proud of at this point of the course.
 * The Contact page has links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, Resume, Email Address, and Phone Number.
